My goal as a researcher is to understand the mechanisms behind diseases by using personalised models in biomedical and biotechnological projects. To do this, I lean on tools from mathematics and computer science to solve interesting problems in biology. 

Particularly, I am interested in combining multi-omics patient data to build multiscale models of cellular behaviours that merge intracellular models, agents for cells and a complex environment. Once built, these models need to be optimised to run efficiently in high-performance computers to have real-sized simulations, scaling-up the scope of projects.

If these subjects resonate with your interests, feel free to reach out!
