abstract = "Synthetic Biology is a revolutionary scientific discipline. The ability to design and construct new biological systems with useful properties opens up a challenging scenario for the technological development of humanity. However, new science needs new regulations, and Human Practices dealing with Synthetic Biology must be defined in order to provide an ethical, legal and regulatory framework within which this novel scientific area can develop. Sins, Ethics and Biology, a Comprehensive Approach, is more than just a review on Human Practices and Synthetic Biology: it encompasses a classical review of scientific reports on HP; the first comparative analysis of previous iGEM HP projects; interviews with wellknown experts; and the largest survey on ethics and Synthetic Biology ever made. The goal of this book is to help researchers and people interested in SB to assess the new risks, possibilities, and ethical issues of this discipline. We hope you will enjoy reading it as much as we enjoyed putting it together!"
