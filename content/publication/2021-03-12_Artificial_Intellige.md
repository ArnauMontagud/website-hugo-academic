abstract = "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can play a key role in preventing, detecting, and monitoring epidemics. In this paper, we provide an overview of the recently published literature on the COVID-19 pandemic in four strategic areas: (1) triage, diagnosis, and risk prediction; (2) drug repurposing and development; (3) pharmacogenomics and vaccines; and (4) mining of the medical literature. We highlight how AI-powered health care can enable public health systems to efficiently handle future outbreaks and improve patient outcomes."
